I have created this file to learn github from "The coding Train" in youtube also created a branch called newBranch to learn how branches works
they teaches how to create file in github and how github is different than git.
GIT
//
git is a version control and it can use in the window and it is different from github.
before 2018 no one owns git and the guy who build linux have biult the git and other guys, and basically after 2018 officially announced that Microsoft owns it and this open source.


GITHUB
//
github is a software and works with git, we can deploy and create a project called Repository in github website it is hosted online so anyone and anywhere in the world can be accesss.
and this allows us to control over our changes happening in the file


So Idea of branching is that to create another branch to avoid of mistakes, so that when we merge both branches we can cpmare and check if everything is fine if not then we deny it simply
